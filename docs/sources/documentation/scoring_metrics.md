# Scoring metrics


## Regression metrics 

- __explained_variance__: Explained variance regression score function

- __mean_absolute_error__: Mean absolute error regression loss

- __mean_squared_error__: Mean squared error regression loss

- __mean_squared_log_error__: Mean squared logarithmic error regression loss

- __median_absolute_error__: Median absolute error regression loss

- __r2__: R^2 (coefficient of determination) regression score function.


## Classification metrics 
               
- __accuracy__: Accuracy classification score.

- __average_precision__: Compute average precision (AP) from prediction scores

- __brier_score_loss__: Compute the Brier score.

- __f1_score__: Compute the F1 score, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure

- __neg_log_loss__: Negative Log loss, aka logistic loss or cross-entropy loss.

- __precision__: Compute the precision

- __recall__: Compute the recall

- __roc_auc__: Compute Area Under the Curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule
