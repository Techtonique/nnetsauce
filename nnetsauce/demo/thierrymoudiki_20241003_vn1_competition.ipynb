The aim is to accurately forecast future sales for various products across different\n","clients and warehouses, using historical sales and pricing data. \n","\n","Phase 1 was a warmup to get an idea of what works and what wouldn't (and... for overfitting the validation set, so that the leaderboard is almost  meaningless). It's safe to say, based on empirical observations, that an advanced artillery would be useless here. In phase 2 (people are still welcome to enter the challenge, no pre-requisites from phase 1 needed), the validation set is provided, and there's no leaderboard for the test set (which is great, basically: \"real life\"; no overfitting).\n","\n","My definition of \"winning\" the challenge will be to have an accuracy close to the winning solution by a factor of 1% (2 decimals). Indeed, the focus on accuracy means: we are litterally targetting a point on the real line (well, the \"real line\", the interval is probably bounded but still contains an  infinite number of points). If the metric was a metric for quantifying uncertainty... there would be too much winners :) \n","\n","In the examples, I show you how you can start the competition by benchmarking 30 statistical/Machine Learning models on a few products, based on the validation set provided yesterday. No tuning, no overfitting. Only hold-out set validation. You can notice, on some examples, that a model can be the most accurate on point forecasting, but completely off-track when trying to capture the uncertainty aroung the point forecast. Food for thought.
